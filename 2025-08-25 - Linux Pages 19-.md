## üìù Key Points (in my own words)
## Intermediate commands
### `grep`
**Purpose**: `grep` prints the lines from a file or an input stream that exactly matches the given expression. 
**Syntax**:
```
grep root /etc/passwd
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- `grep` is extremely handy when you want to find the words from multiple files. It gives the file name along with the matched words while printing the output. For example
```
grep root /etc/*
```
- To tell `grep` that you want a case-insensitive search, you use the option `-i`.
- To tell `grep` that you want to find the words that do not match (inverse / invert search), you use the option -v
- `grep` also supports regular expressions. There is also an alternate grep version called `egrep` which is just a synonym for `grep -e`
- Three most important regular expressions to remember
	- `.*` matches any number of characters, including none 
	- `.+` matches one or more characters
	- `.` matches exactly one arbitrary character

### `less`
**Purpose**: `less` is a pager and is useful when the file is too big and you want to only read one screenful at a time.
**Syntax**: 
```
less /usr/share/dict/words
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- Press the spacebar to go forward the file while in less
- Press q to quit
- Press lowercase b to go back one screenful
- Press /word to search inside less
- Press ?word to search backwards

### `pwd`
**Purpose**: `pwd` is used to print the current working directory 
**Syntax**: 
```
pwd
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments: 
- Symlinks are basically shortcuts or pointers to another file or directory
- When you `cd` into a symlink, the shell remembers the path you typed, but not the actual directory
- In this case, use `pwd -P` to eliminate the confusion and let the shell give you the actual original path rather than the symlink path.

### `diff`
**Purpose**: `diff` is used to find differences between files
**Syntax**:
```
diff file1 file2
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**: 
- Most of the times `diff` is sufficient to find the differences, but for more human readable format, use `diff -u file1 file2`
- `diff` only shows which line the difference occurs rather than focusing on the word itself but `diff -u` focuses on the word, rather than letting you know the line etc.
- If you're familiar with `git diff`, it uses `diff -u` under the hood.

### `file`
**Purpose**: `file` command lets you view the format of the file.
**Syntax**: 
```
file file
```
### `find` and `locate`
**Purpose**: `find` and `locate` are used to find the files from either the current directory or a directory specified
**Syntax**: 
```
find dir -name file -print
```
- The above command is used to find a file named file in a specified directory dir
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- Unlike `find` which finds the file on the go, `locate` finds the files based on its previous index.
- `locate` is faster than `find` because it searches from the index but if the file is not available in the index yet, `locate` will not find the file
- `locate` might not be available on all the distributions and can be installed using package managers searching for *plocate*. The index of locate can be updated using `updatedb` command.

### `head` and `tail`
**Purpose**: The head and tail commands allow you to quickly view a portion of a file or a stream of data. `head` shows the first 10 lines by default and `tail` shows the last 10 lines by default. 
**Syntax**: 
```
head /etc/passwd
tail /etc/passwd
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments / Notes**:
- The default option of number of lines can be changed by using the `-n` flag. For example, to only view the first 5 lines from the beginning of a file, you can use omit specifying `-n` in the command and use `head -5 /etc/passwd`
- In the same way, to only view the last 5 lines from the file, `tail -5 /etc/passwd`
- You can also print lines starting at a specific line n, using `tail +n /etc/passwd` where n is the line you want to start from.

### `sort`
**Purpose**: `sort` command, by default, puts the lines of a text in alphanumeric order. 
**Syntax**: 
```
sort /etc/passwd
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- To sort by numerical order, use the `-n` flag `sort -n /etc/passwd`
- To reverse the order, use `-r` flag `sort -r /etc/passwd`
