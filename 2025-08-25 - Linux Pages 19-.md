## 📝 Key Points (in my own words)
## Intermediate commands
### `grep`
**Purpose**: `grep` prints the lines from a file or an input stream that exactly matches the given expression. 
**Syntax**:
```
grep root /etc/passwd
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- `grep` is extremely handy when you want to find the words from multiple files. It gives the file name along with the matched words while printing the output. For example
```
grep root /etc/*
```
- To tell `grep` that you want a case-insensitive search, you use the option `-i`.
- To tell `grep` that you want to find the words that do not match (inverse / invert search), you use the option -v
- `grep` also supports regular expressions. There is also an alternate grep version called `egrep` which is just a synonym for `grep -e`
- Three most important regular expressions to remember
	- `.*` matches any number of characters, including none 
	- `.+` matches one or more characters
	- `.` matches exactly one arbitrary character

### `less`
**Purpose**: `less` is a pager and is useful when the file is too big and you want to only read one screenful at a time.
**Syntax**: 
```
less /usr/share/dict/words
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- Press the spacebar to go forward the file while in less
- Press q to quit
- Press lowercase b to go back one screenful
- Press /word to search inside less
- Press ?word to search backwards
