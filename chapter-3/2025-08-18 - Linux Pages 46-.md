## üìñ Pages Covered
From page: 46  To page: 
- kernel provides most device i/o operations as files
- these _device files_ are sometimes called _device nodes_ 
- devices are usually located in `/dev` directory
- to send the output of a command to a null device, you can do the below
```
echo something > /dev/null
```
- to see the permissions of the devices inside the `/dev` directory, use `ls -l /dev`
- the first character of the output denotes the device type.
    - `b` indicates that it is a block type device
    - `c` indicates that it is a character type device
    - `p` indicates that it is a pipe type device
    - `s` indicates that it is a socket type device
#### block devices
- block devices are used to read the data in blocks
- the size of the block devices are fixed so they are easy to index and the kernel can pick 
any block of the device when needed
- hard disks are usually block devices as their size is fixed
#### character devices
- you can only read or write characters to a character device like `/dev/null`
- as the character devices do not have a fixed size, the kernel performs read and write operations when writing to it or reading from it
- printers directly attached to the computer are represented by character devices
#### pipe devices
- _named pipes_ are character devices but the only difference is there will be another process at the end of i/o stream instead of a kernel driver
#### socket devices
- socket devices are usually useful for interprocess communications and are usually located outside `/dev` directory

- when you do `ls -l /dev` the number in the output below before the dates are the _major_ and _minor_ device numbers that the kernel uses to identify the device. for example, hard disks like _sda1_ and _sda2_ both have the same numbers
```
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 sep 6 08:37 sda1
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 sep 6 08:37 null
prw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 mar 3 19:17 fdata
srw-rw-rw- 1 root root 0 dec 18 07:43 log
```

START
Basic
Front: How do block devices read data?
Back: Block devices read data in blocks
<!--ID: 1758005743117-->
END

START
Basic
Front: Why are block devices easy to index?
Back: Because the size of block devices is fixed, so the kernel can pick any block of the device when needed
<!--ID: 1758005743121-->
END

START
Basic
Front: What type of devices are hard disks usually represented as?
Back: Block devices, as their size is fixed
<!--ID: 1758005743126-->
END

START
Basic
Front: What can you do with character devices?
Back: You can only read or write characters to a character device like `/dev/null`
<!--ID: 1758005743129-->
END

START
Basic
Front: Why does the kernel perform read and write operations differently for character devices?
Back: Because character devices do not have a fixed size, the kernel performs read and write operations when writing to it or reading from it
<!--ID: 1758005743156-->
END

START
Basic
Front: What are printers directly attached to computers represented as?
Back: Character devices
<!--ID: 1758005743164-->
END

START
Basic
Front: How are named pipes different from regular character devices?
Back: Named pipes are character devices but the difference is there will be another process at the end of I/O stream instead of a kernel driver
