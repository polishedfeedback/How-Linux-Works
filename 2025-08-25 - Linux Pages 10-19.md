## üìù Key Points (in my own words)

## The Bourne Shell
- Shell is a program that runs commands, like the ones we enter into a terminal window
- Most important parts of the Linux system are **_Shell Scripts_**. These are the text files that contain a series of instructions on what to do and how to perform some action
- All the shell functions derive features from the bourne shell (/bin/sh) developed for Bell Labs for early versions of Unix.
- Linux uses an enhanced version of bourne shell called bash (bourne again shell) and is linked to /bin/sh
- To change your default shell use the command `chsh` and enter the link to the shell that you would like to use.

## The Shell Window
- Shell window is a window where you enter commands. It is also often referred as a terminal.
- Most of the shell prompts start with `$`. This means you're logged in as a regular user. For example, 
```
$ echo Hello there
```
- When the shell prompts start with `#`, you're logged in as a superuser or root. For example,
```
# pacman -Syyu && pacman -Syuu
```
- The best way to run commands that require root access is by using sudo 
- Most of the commands (not all) usually begin with the name of the command and optional flags or arguments.
- You can enter the arguments first and then flags later too
- Flags are usually there to modify the default behaviour of a command 
### `cat`
- **Purpose**: output contents of the given files or another source of input.
- **Syntax**:
   ```
   cat file1 file2 ...
   ```
- `cat` is derived from the word concatenate as the main purpose of it is to concatenate the output of the given input, combine it and spit combined output.
### Standard Input (stdin)
- Unix processes use I/O streams to read and write data. 
- This is very convenient because the input stream can be anything a file, a device, a terminal window or even the output stream from another process
- Running `cat` without arguments will keep `cat` running until an EOF is received.
- In the time, cat will take input from the standard input that the kernel provides it and spits the exact output. This will continue until an EOF (End of File) is received.
- You can send the EOF signal by using `CTRL-D`
- This is not the same thing as `CTRL-C` as it sends the signal to terminate the program immediately
### Standard Output (stdout)
- Kernel gives an output stream for every process to write the data
- `cat` usually writes its output to the stdout which is terminal
#### Summary of standard streams
- **stdin** - standard input (keyboard by default)
- **stdout** - standard output (screen by default)
- **stderr** - standard error (for errors)

## Basic Commands
### `ls`
**Purpose**: Lists the files and directories in the current directory or a specified directory
**Syntax**:
```
ls dir/
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- `ls -F` displays the file type information
- `ls -l` displays the long list of the specified directory or current directory
- `ls -h` displays the human readable format of file or directory sizes
- When using `ls -l` the long list gives you user / owner information on column 3, group information on column 4, the file size on column 5, Modified date on column 6
### `cp`
**Purpose**: cp copies files to the current directory or a specified directory
**Syntax**: 
```
cp file1 file2
```
**Additional flags / arguments**
- You can copy any number of files to a specified directory keeping the same filename in the directory
  ```
  cp file1 file2 file3 dir
	```

### `mv`
**Purpose**: Main purpose of mv command is to rename the files but the same syntax can also be used to move the files
**Syntax**:
```
mv file1 file2
```

### `touch`
**Purpose**: `touch` is used to create a file. If the file already exists, `touch` won't change the contents of the file, but will change the modified time.
You can also create multiple files using `touch file1 file2 file3 ...`
**Syntax**: 
```
touch file
```

### `rm`
**Purpose**: `rm` is used to delete files. If the files are deleted, there's no way to get them back until and unless there is some backup
**Syntax**:
```
rm file1 file2 ...
```

### `echo`
**Purpose**: `echo` is used to print its arguments to the standard output
**Syntax**:
```
echo hello there
```

## Navigating directories
- The Unix hierarchy starts at `/`. This is called as root directory.
- `~` is called home directory of the particular user
- The directory separator is `/`.
- If the path starts with `/`, then it is called as **absolute path**
- If the path doesn't start with a `/`, then it is called **relative path**
- two dots `..` refers to the parent directory of the current directory
- one dot `.` refers to the current directory

### `cd`
**Purpose**:
- `cd` refers to change directory and is used to change the directories.
- You can see the current working directory either on the shell prompt or by using the `pwd` command
**Syntax**:
```
cd dir
```
- If you omit the arguments to the `cd` command and only enter `cd`, then the shell returns to your home directory. It is also denoted by `~` (tilde)
- `cd` is a shell built-in

### `mkdir`
 **Purpose**: `mkdir` is used to make directories.
 **Syntax**:
 ```
 mkdir dir
 ```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**
- to create a folder inside another folder, for e.g., to create a directory called dir2 inside dir1 (which is yet to be created), we can use -p flag.
  ```
  mkdir -p dir1/dir2
  ```

### rmdir
**Purpose**: 
- `rmdir` is used to remove / delete directories
- It only deletes the directories if empty, if not, it expects you to delete all the files or subdirectories from the directory first and then use the command again.
**Syntax**:
```
rmdir dir
```
**Additional Flags / Arguments**:
- If the directory is not empty and you know that the files inside should be deleted too, you can use `rm -rf dir`, which deletes the directory and the subdirectories including files inside that directory recursively. 
- Once this is done, you can't get the files back
- Use this command with caution as if not used properly, and when you run it as a superuser, it can do serious damage. 
- Do not use the `-r` flag especially with the globs `*` as it will delete everything in your system when the right access is given.

## Shell Globbing ("Wildcards")
- Shell can match certain patterns and give you only the files that match those patterns. This is called **globbing**
- For example, `*` matches all the files and `echo *` gives all the files in the current directory
- This is also called ***expansion*** because, the shell matches the pattern, substitutes it with the filenames, and re-runs the command line.
- Some of the ways to use `*` are
	- `*at` matches all the filenames that end with *at*
	- `at*` matches all the filenames that start with *at*
	- `*at*` matches all the filenames that contain *at*
#### `?`
- Another shell glob character is the question mark character `?` which tells the shell to match exactly one arbitrary character. For example, `b?at` matches *brat* and also *boat*
- If you do not want the shell to expand the glob in the command, you use single quotes '?'. For example  `echo '*'` prints a star
