## 📝 Key Points (in my own words)
- Filesystem is just a translator between kernel's raw block devices like /dev/sda1 etc and user's organised view (/home/user/Downloads)
- It is also a database for organising and storing files
- It also keeps track of Filenames, Location, Metadata and which blocks on the disk holds the file
- Initially filesystems lived only on Physical disks but linux introduced FUSE (filesystem in Userspace)
- But the introduction of virtual filesystems (VFS) enabled a common interface for the user programs to use, read and write and also kernel to perform actions
- Just like how SCSI provides common interface for different devices, VFS provides a standard interface for the user-space applications to access files and directories
- The introduction of VFS enabled Linux to support all the filesystems like btrfs, ext4, ntfs, tmpfs etc
- This basically helps programs like cp, ls, cat etc to just do their thing without caring much about what filesystem is used just because VFS provides a common interface to access the files
