## üìù Key Points (in my own words)
- Filesystem is just a translator between kernel's raw block devices like /dev/sda1 etc and user's organised view (/home/user/Downloads)
- It is also a database for organising and storing files
- It also keeps track of Filenames, Location, Metadata and which blocks on the disk holds the file
- Initially filesystems lived only on Physical disks but linux introduced FUSE (filesystem in Userspace)
- But the introduction of virtual filesystems (VFS) enabled a common interface for the user programs to use, read and write and also kernel to perform actions
- Just like how SCSI provides common interface for different devices, VFS provides a standard interface for the user-space applications to access files and directories
- The introduction of VFS enabled Linux to support all the filesystems like btrfs, ext4, ntfs, tmpfs etc
- This basically helps programs like cp, ls, cat etc to just do their thing without caring much about what filesystem is used just because VFS provides a common interface to access the files

### Filesystem types
- Following are the filesystem types recognized by Linux
    - `ext4` is the current iteration of a file systems native to Linux (Forth Extended System). `ext2` was a standard filesystem for linux for a long time and it was then replaced by `ext3` which supported a bit of caching. `ext4` supports bigger files than `ext2` and `ext3` and more subdirectories as well
    - `B-tree filesystem` or `btrfs` is the newer file system native to Linux designed to scale beyond the capabilities of `ext4`   
    - `FAT` filesystem (*msdos*, *vfat*, *exfat*) are used by microsoft. Most removable media such as SD-cards and USB drives contain vfat(up to 4 GB) or exfat (4GB and up) by default. Windows systems can use either `FAT` or the more advanced`NTFS`   
    - `XFS` is more high-performance filesystem used by default by some distributions, such as RHEL
    - `HFS+` is an Apple Standard used on most Macintosh systems
    - `ISO 9660` is a CD-ROM standard and is used mostly on CD-ROMs 

### Creating a filesystem
- Once you partition your device, you can create a file system on your device that is partitioned
- You should only make a filesystem once you partition the disk and only when you want the data on the disk needs to be removed.
- You can make a filesystem using `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda2` and mkfs will automatically determine the number of blocks in a device and sets some reasonable defaults.
- `mkfs` prints diagnostic output when you run the command, including the output pertaining *superblock*  
- *superblock* is so important that `mkfs` creates backups to it   
- *superblock* is nothing but a component sitting at the top of filesystem and has the metadata of filesystem (think of this as table of contents needed for the OS to understand and manage the filesystem)
- `mkfs` is just a frontend and a symbolic link to the other programs. For example, mkfs.ext4 is just a symbolic link to `mke2fs`   
- You can view this by using `ls -l /sbin/mkfs.*` 

### Mounting a filesystem
- Attaching a filesystem to the running system is called *mounting* 
- In order to mount, you just need to know the devices location, filesystem type, and where on system you would like to mount the device
- To check the current filesystem status on your system, simply run `mount`
- Remember this terminology, *mount a device on a mount point* 
- If you look at the output of `mount`, you will see the same terminology mounting a device, for e.g., /dev/sda *on* the mount point, for e.g., /var/log *type* btrfs and also the mount options in the parantheses
- To mount a filesystem you can use `mount -t type device mountpoint`
- For example, to mount a `ext4` filesystem found on the device `/dev/sda2` on `/home/mydrive` use this `mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /home/mydrive` 
- To unmount the device you can simply use `unmount /home/mydrive` or `/unmount /dev/sda2`  
- Most of the linux distributions include a temporary mount point called `/mnt` which is typically used for testing. You can mount the device you would like to test on this mount point instead but for extended use, it is better to make another spot
