## 📝 Key Points (in my own words)
- Device names like `/dev/sda` represents the whole disk 
- Names like `/dev/sda1` `/dev/sda2` represnets the partitions on a disk
- Kernel presents `/dev/sda` and the partitions mentioned above as block devices
- Partitions are defined on a small area of a disk called *partition table*  
- A disk as explained contains partitions and each partition has a database of files and directories called *file system* which manages filesystem data structures (like inodes, allocation tables)
- It also stores the file data (actual content of the files)
