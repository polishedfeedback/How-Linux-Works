## üìù Key Points (in my own words)
- Device names like `/dev/sda` represents the whole disk 
- Names like `/dev/sda1` `/dev/sda2` represnets the partitions on a disk
- Kernel presents `/dev/sda` and the partitions mentioned above as block devices
- Partitions are defined on a small area of a disk called *partition table*  
- A disk as explained contains partitions and each partition has a database of files and directories called *file system* which manages filesystem data structures (like inodes, allocation tables)
- It also stores the file data (actual content of the files)
- To access the file database you might need to access a particular partition first and then search the file system database on that partition to get the desired data
- Linux uses multiple layers to access the disks.
- You can access the disks either through the file system or directly through device files
- User processes like `cp`, `cat` etc operate through system calls like `read()`, `write()`, `open()`, `close()` etc and the kernel sits in between the storage device and the user processes to handle everything
- Programs like `dd`, `parted` etc can operate directly by accessing the disk device like `/dev/sda` etc to perform operations.  

### Partitioning Disk devices
- As explained, kernel presents each partition as a device file and numbers after the whole block device
- Paritition table basically shows how the disk is divided
- There are many kinds of partition tables. Old computers mostly use MBR (Master Boot Record) which has certain limitations and the latest computers use GPT (Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table)
- Here are few of the many partitioning tools:
    - `parted` - supports both MBR and GPT. CLI based 
    - `gparted` - supports both MBR and GPT. GUI based 
    - `fdisk` - supports MBR and the latest versions support GPT as well
    - `gdisk` - supports GPT. `gdisk` is basically the GPT version of the `fdisk`  

### Viewing a partition table 
- Use `parted -l` to view the system's partition table 
- We can also use `fdisk -l` to view the system's partition table
- Output for both shows what partition table is used i.e., gpt or mbr, the file system and also the flags

### Initial kernel Read
- When kernel reads the MBR initially it produces a debug output and can be viewed using `journalctl -k` 
- It shows the extended partitions and the logical partitions of the MBR table which looks something like the below
```
sda: sda1 sda2 < sda5 >
```
- Here, sda2 is the extended partition containing sda5, the logical partition

### Modifying partition tables
- Using `fdisk` to modify a partition table is different to using `parted`  
- With `fdisk` you make the partition table and then when you exit the program the changes will be committed but with `parted`, changes are made as you issue the commands
- `fdisk` changes can be seen by viewing `journalctl -k` as it makes a system call to the kernel about all the partition table changes but the chagnes made by `parted`, cannot be seen there as they don't make a disk wide system call. They just singal the kernel whenever individual partitions are altered.
- Few ways to see the partition changes
    - Using `udevadm` to watch the kernel event changes. `udevadm monitor --kernel` will show old partition devices being removed and the new ones being added
    - Checking `/proc/partitions` for full partition information
    - Checking `/sys/block/device/` for altered partition system interfaces or `/dev` for altered partition devices
- If you want to force a partition reload, you can use `blockdev` command which makes the system call that `fdisk` issues. For example to force a partition table reload on `/dev/sdf`, run the below
```
blockdev --rereadapt /dev/sdf
```
