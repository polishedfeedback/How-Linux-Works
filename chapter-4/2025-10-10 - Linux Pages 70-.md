## 📝 Key Points (in my own words)
- Device names like `/dev/sda` represents the whole disk 
- Names like `/dev/sda1` `/dev/sda2` represnets the partitions on a disk
- Kernel presents `/dev/sda` and the partitions mentioned above as block devices
- Partitions are defined on a small area of a disk called *partition table*  
- A disk as explained contains partitions and each partition has a database of files and directories called *file system* which manages filesystem data structures (like inodes, allocation tables)
- It also stores the file data (actual content of the files)
- To access the file database you might need to access a particular partition first and then search the file system database on that partition to get the desired data
- Linux uses multiple layers to access the disks.
- You can access the disks either through the file system or directly through device files
- User processes like `cp`, `cat` etc operate through system calls like `read()`, `write()`, `open()`, `close()` etc and the kernel sits in between the storage device and the user processes to handle everything
- Programs like `dd`, `parted` etc can operate directly by accessing the disk device like `/dev/sda` etc to perform operations.  

### Partitioning Disk devices
- As explained, kernel presents each partition as a device file and numbers after the whole block device
- Paritition table basically shows how the disk is divided
- There are many kinds of partition tables. Old computers mostly use MBR (Master Boot Record) which has certain limitations and the latest computers use GPT (Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table)
- Here are few of the many partitioning tools:
    - `parted` - supports both MBR and GPT. CLI based 
    - `gparted` - supports both MBR and GPT. GUI based 
    - `fdisk` - supports MBR and the latest versions support GPT as well
    - `gdisk` - supports GPT. `gdisk` is basically the GPT version of the `fdisk`  

### Viewing a partition table 
- Use `parted -l` to view the system's partition table
