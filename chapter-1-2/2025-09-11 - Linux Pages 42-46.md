## üìù Key Points (in my own words)

### Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials
- `/` is the root directory
- `/bin` contains ready-to-run programs (also known as executables) including most of the basic Unix comamnds such as `ls` and `cp`
- `/dev` contains device files
- `/etc`, also pronounced as EHT-see contains system configuration files and also contains user password, boot, device, networking, and other setup files
- `/home` contains home / personal directories for regular users.
- `/lib` / library contains library files that executables can use. There are two types of libraries, shared and static. `/lib` should only contain shared libraries but other lib directories, such as `/usr/lib` contains both of them and also auxiliary files.
- `/proc` provides system statistics thorugh browsable directory-and-file interface. The `/proc` contains information about currently running processes as well as some kernel parameters
- `/run` contains run time data specific to the system, including process IDs, socket files, status records.
- `/sys` is similar to proc and it provides a device and system interface
- `/sbin` is for system executables. Programs inside `/sbin` relate to system management, so regular users do not have `/sbin` in their command paths
- `/tmp` is for temporary data. Be careful to not put anything important in `/tmp` as some systems clean this directory when the machine boots
- `/usr` is pronounced as user but it doesn't contain any user related things. Most of the directories here are the same as the ones in the root directory. For example, `/bin` and `/usr/bin`. The reason for both the directories is, in the earlier days, the root directory is just for the minimal setup and has a very limited space used to boot the system. `/usr` is mounted on the system and until this is mounted, the root directory should contain the very minimal commands to boot up the system until /usr is mounted. So `/` directory contains the executables that are essential to boot up the system and `/usr` has all the system related stuff
- `/var` is another name for variable meaning the programs record information that might change over the course of time. system logging is done in `/var/log`.

### Other root sub directories
- `/boot` contains kernel boot loader files. These are only useful until the very first stage of the startup procedure.
- `/media` contains removable media such as flash drives
- `/opt` contains additional third party software

### The `/usr` Directory
- `/include` - contains header files used by C compiler
- `/local` - This is where administrators install their own software. Its structure should be somewhat similar to `/` and `/usr`
- `/man` - Contains manual pages
- `/share` - contains files that should work on every system regardless of the architecture. Usually this directory contains documetation, fonts etc.

### Kernel location
- On Linux, kernel is basically a regular binary file `/vmlinuz` or `/boot/vmlinuz`. 
- A boot loader loads this file into memory and sets it in motion when the system boots
- The modules that kernel loads and unloads on demand during the course of normal system operation are called _loadable kernel modules_ and they are located under `/lib/modules`

### Sudo
- Most commands that require administrator privileges to run them. 
- You should login as root to execute them
- Rather you use something called `sudo` before the command
- For example, to edit the `/etc/passwd` you can run `sudo vipw` which basically runs the command as an administrator
- Doing this is better because `sudo` logs this action with the syslog service under the local2 facility.

### /etc/sudoers
- Not everyone can execute commands using sudo.
- To do this one must be configured in `/etc/sudoers` file.
- To edit `/etc/sudoers`, use `visudo` command
- To give user1 and user2 the power to run any command without having to enter the password, you can do the below
```
User_Alias ADMINS = user1, user2 -- defines an alias called ADMINS and adds user1, user2 to that 
ADMINS ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL -- all the admins can execute all the commands without a password
root ALL=(ALL) ALL -- superuser may also use sudo to run any commands on any machine as any user
```
### sudo logs
- You can find the logs by using `journalctl SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=sudo`
- On older systems, you can find the log file in `/var/log`, such as `/var/log/auth.log`
