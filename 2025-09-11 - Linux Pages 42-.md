## üìù Key Points (in my own words)

### Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials
- `/` is the root directory
- `/bin` contains ready-to-run programs (also known as executables) including most of the basic Unix comamnds such as `ls` and `cp`
- `/dev` contains device files
- `/etc`, also pronounced as EHT-see contains system configuration files and also contains user password, boot, device, networking, and other setup files
- `/home` contains home / personal directories for regular users.
- `/lib` / library contains library files that executables can use. There are two types of libraries, shared and static. `/lib` should only contain shared libraries but other lib directories, such as `/usr/lib` contains both of them and also auxiliary files.
- `/proc` provides system statistics thorugh browsable directory-and-file interface. The `/proc` contains information about currently running processes as well as some kernel parameters
- `/run` contains run time data specific to the system, including process IDs, socket files, status records.
- `/sys` is similar to proc and it provides a device and system interface
- `/sbin` is for system executables. Programs inside `/sbin` relate to system management, so regular users do not have `/sbin` in their command paths
- `/tmp` is for temporary data. Be careful to not put anything important in `/tmp` as some systems clean this directory when the machine boots
- `/usr` is pronounced as user but it doesn't contain any user related things. Most of the directories here are the same as the ones in the root directory. For example, `/bin` and `/usr/bin`. The reason for both the directories is, in the earlier days, the root directory is just for the minimal setup and has a very limited space used to boot the system. `/usr` is mounted on the system and until this is mounted, the root directory should contain the very minimal commands to boot up the system until /usr is mounted. So `/` directory contains the executables that are essential to boot up the system and `/usr` has all the system related stuff
- `/var` is another name for variable meaning the programs record information that might change over the course of time. system logging is done in `/var/log`.

### Other root sub directories
- `/boot` contains kernel boot loader files. These are only useful until the very first stage of the startup procedure.
- `/media` contains removable media such as flash drives
- `/opt` contains additional third party software

### The `/usr` Directory
